adm/jobs is responsible for orchestrating and running jobs for coinexplorer adm.

- Provides an interface for running jobs by name, as triggered by adm/http (POST /jobs/<name>/run)
- Handles job execution, status tracking, and result collection
- Integrates with jobruns database for run status and metrics
- Can be extended to support new job types and orchestration logic

## Usage

- Import adm/jobs in adm/http or other orchestrators to trigger jobs by name
- Expose a function like `runJob(name: string, params?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<JobRunResult>`
- Job execution should be idempotent and observable (logs, metrics)

## Example

```ts
import { runJob } from "./mod.ts";
const result = await runJob("download-solana-tokens");
```
