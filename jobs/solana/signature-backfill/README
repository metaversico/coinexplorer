jobs/solana/signature-backfill schedules RPC calls to backfill transaction signatures for Solana markets using receipt-based state management.

- Loads Solana markets from markets.yml configuration  
- Uses receipts to track the last signature processed for each market individually
- Schedules getSignaturesForAddress RPC calls to continue from where each market left off
- Creates receipts for each scheduled RPC call to maintain state for future runs
- Supports both initial collection and incremental backfill per market

## Usage

Run to backfill signatures for all Solana markets:

```ts
import { runJob } from "../../../adm/jobs/mod.ts";
const result = await runJob("solana/signature-backfill", ["run-123"]);
```

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `SOLANA_RPC_URL` - Solana RPC endpoint (default: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com)
- `MAX_SIGNATURES_PER_CALL` - Maximum signatures to request per call (default: 1000)

## Parameters

- `args[0]` - Job run ID for tracking RPC calls

## Receipt-Based State Management

The job uses receipts to track progress independently for each market:

1. **Origin URI**: `solana-signature-backfill/<market-name>`
2. **Target URI**: `rpc_call/<rpc-call-id>`

For each market, the job:
- Queries receipts to find the most recent RPC call for that market
- Extracts the last signature from the RPC call result using SQL function `get_last_signature_for_market()`
- Uses that signature as the 'before' parameter for the next RPC call
- Creates a new receipt linking the market to the scheduled RPC call

## Job Flow

1. Loads Solana markets from markets.yml
2. For each market:
   - Calls `get_last_signature_for_market(market_name)` to find continuation point
   - If signature found: schedules call using it as 'before' parameter
   - If none found: schedules initial signature collection call
   - Creates receipt linking market to the scheduled RPC call
3. Returns summary of scheduled calls per market

## Output

Returns object with:
- `message` - Summary of operation
- `markets` - Array of processed market names  
- `scheduledCalls` - Array of RPC call IDs created
