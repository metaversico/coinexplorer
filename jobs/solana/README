jobs/solana contains Solana-specific data collection jobs for metadata and transaction processing.

- metadata-job.ts - Schedules RPC calls to collect Solana token metadata
- signature-backfill/ - Backfills transaction signatures for Solana markets

These jobs work in coordination with rpc-executor and rpc-processor to:
1. Schedule data collection requests
2. Execute RPC calls with rate limiting  
3. Process and store results in the database

## Usage

Jobs are run via the job orchestrator:

```ts
import { runJob } from "../../adm/jobs/mod.ts";
await runJob("solana/metadata-job");
await runJob("solana/signature-backfill");
```
