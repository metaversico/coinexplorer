jobs/test-error is a test job that deliberately throws an error for testing error handling.

- Throws a deliberate error with stack trace for testing purposes
- Used to verify job runner error handling and logging
- Tests job status updates when jobs fail unexpectedly
- Validates error reporting and monitoring systems

## Usage

Run to test error handling in job execution:

```ts
import { runJob } from "../adm/jobs/mod.ts";
const result = await runJob("test-error");
```

## Expected Behavior

The job will:
1. Throw an Error with message "This is a test error with a stack trace"
2. Job status should be marked as 'failed' in the database
3. Error details should be logged and stored for monitoring

## Job Flow

1. Starts execution
2. Immediately throws an Error
3. Job runner catches error and updates job status
4. Error is logged with stack trace information
