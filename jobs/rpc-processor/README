jobs/rpc-processor processes completed RPC call results and extracts meaningful data.

- Retrieves completed RPC calls from the database for processing
- Groups calls by method type for efficient batch processing
- Processes Solana-specific RPC responses (metadata, signatures)
- Extracts and stores structured data from raw RPC responses
- Supports extensible processing for different RPC methods

## Usage

Run as a scheduled job to process completed RPC calls:

```ts
import { runJob } from "../adm/jobs/mod.ts";
const result = await runJob("rpc-processor");
```

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `RPC_PROCESSING_BATCH_SIZE` - Number of completed calls to process per run (default: 50)

## Supported Methods

- `getAccountInfo` - Processes Solana account metadata via processSolanaMetadataResults
- `getSignaturesForAddress` - Processes Solana signature data via processSolanaSignatureResults

## Job Flow

1. Fetches completed Solana RPC calls from database
2. Groups calls by RPC method type
3. Routes each method group to appropriate processor:
   - Account metadata extraction for token information
   - Signature processing for transaction history
4. Logs processing results and error handling
